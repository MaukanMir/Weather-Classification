# About Dataset

## Description
#### This dataset is synthetically generated to mimic weather data for classification tasks. It includes various weather-related features and categorizes the weather into four types: Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, and Snowy. This dataset is designed for practicing classification algorithms, data preprocessing, and outlier detection methods.

## Variables
- Temperature (numeric): The temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from extreme cold to extreme heat.
- Humidity (numeric): The humidity percentage, including values above 100% to introduce outliers.
- Wind Speed (numeric): The wind speed in kilometers per hour, with a range including unrealistically high values.
- Precipitation (%) (numeric): The precipitation percentage, including outlier values.
- Cloud Cover (categorical): The cloud cover description.
- Atmospheric Pressure (numeric): The atmospheric pressure in hPa, covering a wide range.
- UV Index (numeric): The UV index, indicating the strength of ultraviolet radiation.
- Season (categorical): The season during which the data was recorded.
- Visibility (km) (numeric): The visibility in kilometers, including very low or very high values.
- Location (categorical): The type of location where the data was recorded.
- Weather Type (categorical): The target variable for classification, indicating the weather type.

## Purpose and Utility
#### This dataset is useful for data scientists, students especially beginners, and practitioners to investigate classification algorithm's performance, practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and test outlier detection methods. It provides opportunities for learning and experimenting with weather data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Important Note
#### This dataset is synthetically produced and does not convey real-world weather data. It includes intentional outliers to provide opportunities for practicing outlier detection and handling. The values, ranges, and distributions may not accurately represent real-world conditions, and the data should primarily be used for educational and experimental purposes.
